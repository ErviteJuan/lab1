           		<h3>What is Design Thinking? </h3>
<br><br>
Design Thinking is a non-linear process that focuses on defining and solving a problem that is plaguing a user. 
It consists of 5 phases, not necessarily in a strict order, that help the designer in creating what the problem 
needs and how it should be solved. It also involves “thinking outside the box” as the easiest solutions are 
sometimes hard to come by due to restrictions in one’s profession or perspective. 
<br>

The 5 phases are: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Testing. These are usually done in that order however
 there are instances that you can go to previous steps in order to review the product in order to refine the method 
or come up with more efficient solutions to the problem
<br>
One theme is that is always referenced is the ability to “think outside the box”. This is because some problems are 
solved through unusual means that have the most efficient method. A story referenced is the truck that got stuck 
under a bridge when it didn’t have enough clearance. Many experts tried various solutions that yielded the truck 
either being disassembled or chipping the bridge. One boy passing by suggested to deflate the tires and let the 
truck move on its own. Even when experts are in the area, it's always good to be open to others or through sources. 
<br>
This sums up what Design Thinking to me is. It is an iterative process that solves problems through 5 phases with
 the main idea being to come up with different solutions to problems along the way. It looks for the most efficient
 solution as its main goal.
