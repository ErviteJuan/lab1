<h4>What is Design Thinking? </h4>
<p>Design Thinking is a non-linear process that focuses on defining and solving a problem that is plaguing a user. <br>
It consists of 5 phases, not necessarily in a strict order, that help the designer in creating what the problem <br>
needs and how it should be solved. It also involves “thinking outside the box” as the easiest solutions are <br>
sometimes hard to come by due to restrictions in one’s profession or perspective. </p>

<p>The 5 phases are: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Testing. These are usually done in that order however <br>
there are instances that you can go to previous steps in order to review the product in order to refine the method <br>
or come up with more efficient solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>One theme is that is always referenced is the ability to “think outside the box”. This is because some problems <br>
are solved through unusual means that have the most efficient method. A story referenced is the truck that got <br>
stuck under a bridge when it didn’t have enough clearance. Many experts tried various solutions that yielded <br>
the truck either being disassembled or chipping the bridge. One boy passing by suggested to deflate the tires <br>
and let the truck move on its own. Even when experts are in the area, it's always good to be open to others or <br>
through sources. </p>
