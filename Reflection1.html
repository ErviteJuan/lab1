<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Looking at what I had learned from USERDES,I learned the definition of UX and<br> 
UI design and how these two come together, the type of clients I will encounter, the processes of creating a<br> 
user-friendly product, and how I can integrate both to cater for the potential customers and clients.</p>

<p>The steps in creating an effective user interface for software hinges on the clientâ€™s needs. This<br>
was hammered on when researching what various people need, learning what their pain points are, and<br>
how it can be prevented when implementing the overall design. One way was creating scenarios like<br>
Personas which represent the possible types of people you encounter and give an idea on what the<br> 
user interface should feel like.</p>

<p>One experience that could provide insight on what I should and should not do was the User<br> 
Inyerface exercise which focused on creating an anti-user interface that was designed to frustrate<br> 
the user. I was interested on how they manage to create the format and how they twisted the<br>
common UI design to fool the user. Adding steps when inputting your username, mislabeling the pictures, etc.<br> 
It was an interesting experience and give the idea what I should not do and how can I prevent it when<br> 
I design my own software.</p>
