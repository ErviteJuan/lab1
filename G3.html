           		<h3>What is Prototyping? </h3>
<br><br>
Prototyping is the act of creating a framework of a product either in paper or digital/tangible form. It is a
 way for designers to get feedback from users in order to adjust its design and attributes for the betterment 
of what the users need. The two types of prototypes are low-fidelity and high-fidelity. 
<br><br>
<h3>What is the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes </h3>
<br><br>
Low-fidelity prototypes are cheap, easy to create, rough drafts of the products that the designers can use to get 
their first feedback from users. Though it can be hard for the users to interpret and give criticism as the
 prototype doesn’t represent a fully functioning final product.  
<br>
High-fidelity are the usable, functioning, drafts that are usually digital or physical in nature. This can be used 
to show what the product should look, feel, and act as it nears completion. Here, the users can give concrete 
feedback on how they experience on using the product and what should be adjusted. It’s usually high in quality, 
yet expensive and time-consuming to make. 
<br><br>
<h3>Give examples of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes </h3>
Low-fidelity prototypes would include paper prototypes. Paper can be drawn on, removed, and adjusted to show a
 rough presentation on what the product should look like. You can take it even further by making a functioning 
“interface” using scissors and tape to show how it should function. 
<br>
High-fidelity prototypes are fully functioning websites with rough graphics to represent how the website should 
function. It shows where the links are, which pictures should be placed, what type of colors should be used. 
<br><br>
<h3>Why is prototyping important? </h3>
<br><br>
Prototyping is an essential process in Deisgn Process as it is how designers can get feedback from users. 
If Design Process is like Research, then Prototyping is the Questionnaire. It can help give insight to the 
designers on what the users expect from the product and how they want to use it. It can also save time by
 creating rough drafts to see what sticks and what doesn’t
