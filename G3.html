<h4>What is Prototyping? </h4>

<p>Prototyping is the act of creating a framework of a product either in paper or<br>
digital/tangible form. It is a way for designers to get feedback from users in <br>
order to adjust its design and attributes for the betterment of what the users need.<br> 
The two types of prototypes are low-fidelity and high-fidelity. </p>

<h4>What is the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes?</h4>

<p>Low-fidelity prototypes are cheap, easy to create, rough drafts of the products <br>
that the designers can use to get their first feedback from users. Though it can be <br>
hard for the users to interpret and give criticism as the prototype doesn’t represent<br>
 a fully functioning final product.  </p>

<p>High-fidelity are the usable, functioning, drafts that are usually digital or physical <br>
in nature. This can be used to show what the product should look, feel, and act as it <br>
nears completion. Here, the users can give concrete feedback on how they experience on <br>
using the product and what should be adjusted. It’s usually high in quality, yet expensive <br>
and time-consuming to make. </p>

<h4>Give examples of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes </h4>

<p>Low-fidelity prototypes would include paper prototypes. Paper can be drawn on, removed, <br>
and adjusted to show a rough presentation on what the product should look like. You can take <br>
it even further by making a functioning “interface” using scissors and tape to show how it should function. </p>

<p>High-fidelity prototypes are fully functioning websites with rough graphics to represent how the <br>
website should function. It shows where the links are, which pictures should be placed, what type of <br>
colors should be used. </p>

<h4>Why is prototyping important? </h4>

<p>Prototyping is an essential process in Deisgn Process as it is how designers can get feedback <br>
from users. If Design Process is like Research, then Prototyping is the Questionnaire. It can help <br>
give insight to the designers on what the users expect from the product and how they want to use it. <br>
It can also save time by creating rough drafts to see what sticks and what doesn’t </p>
