           		 <p>Information Architecture seems to be a vital part in UI design. The topic covered on 
the slide focuses on Web Design aspect. It taught me the principles of good web design and how it gave me
 perspective on what the users find first. Just like an actual library, the website should show where the user 
is where, and where can they go.  </p>
<br>
	 
            		 <p>It also describes the idea of essential information being at the forefront, but also 
for detailed information being the first thing that the user would look for. Such as copy and pasting the link 
of the information they need to the search engine and finding what they are looking for. </p>
<br>
			<p>Some games don’t even let the player look for the information they need on the game, 
though they would often put compromises. One issue we often have to deal with is with MMOs. Because of the
 RPG aspect, the player has to view all the necessary numbers and stats that their player or their enemy must 
show, the UI is often cluttered with information just at the UI. The menu or character screen would show all
 the concrete numbers that make up the simple turn-based combat.</p>
<br>
			<p>An example would be from WoW, where the bottom of the screen shows the icons of 
the character’s abilities, but not their effects.  If they do want a more detailed information, they would 
open the character screen from the menu and look at their ability list. The designers put the idea of just
 hovering the mouse on the ability icon bare essential information of the player needs to know.</p>
