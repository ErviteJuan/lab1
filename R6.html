           		 <p>Color and Typography are two things that must be accounted for in UI and UX design. 
Color influences the UX design when it comes to color theory and gives a clear pallet on what the product is 
intended for. A professional color scheme would indicate a commercial website while a more relaxed one would
 indicate a recreational setting. Not only that, the user must also be careful in preventing “noise” when 
making their website as powerful colors shown can give eye strain to the user and will ruin the experience.   </p>
<br>
	 
            		 <p>Typography help set the brand or appearance of the product. When reading the text 
in websites, the appropriate fonts should be used when dealing with what type of information it is showing. For
 example, lengthy paragraphs should have simple, readable font that works best in small font sizes. While text 
shown in titles or logos, should be recognizable, stand-out, and give a good impression to the user.  </p>
<br>
			<p>Using these two concepts, it should accounted for when creating my personal website as
 I want to make sure that the user itself should be able to read and enjoy my website, while also give in my own 
personal taste as a sign of branding. However, color is something I had trouble to as I have a hard time gauging
 on what is a good color scheme and would often need internet searching to get the color scheme I want for my portfolio </p>
