<h2>Reflection 3</h2>

<p>Needfinding is the concept of discovering the needs of people. It is<br> 
summarily the act of trying to find a problem that are common to everyday<br> 
life. The reason why is because creating a product means the need of a use or purpose.<br> 
You can’t create a product and not have it to solve a problem. I see it as a<br> 
relative to the Empathic step from Design Thinking.</p> 

<p>The concept of needfinding is new to me, and I even found its name a bit<br> 
humorous, but I do see its application to Design Thinking as a supplement.<br> 
It is an expansion of the first step Empathic. In which the designer looks <br>
for what the user or client want. But that was the key difference, want, the <br>
client wants something to solve their problem. What the designer looks for is <br>
the inherent need of the user and how it should be done. Most of the time, the<br>
clients say what they want, but it is usually hard or impossible to do. So, the <br>
designer supplements the needs to solve their problem. </p>

<p>This concept was the main problem we had in my group in what our users (personas)<br> 
wanted in solving their problem. Our first problem was the design problem we had<br> 
weren’t specific enough to create a viable product. If we went to our original <br>
problem, we would bend over backwards trying to please a broad audience. We ended up<br> 
creating a narrower goal to not only have a concrete design problem, but also the <br>
ease of designing for a specific audience. </br>
