<br>
<p>So far, my favorite application to use is RPGMAKER, as it allowed me to kickstart my ideas on what my first <br>
games should be like. It also taught me common practices on the development cycle and how it can help me save <br>
time and prevent stress. It also allows you to import games to other devices such as Apple OS, iOS, Android, Linux etc.</p>

<h4>How do you use it? </h4>

<p>RPGMAKER uses premade Java Code and grid system to make a basic RPG Game with simple battle design and a <br>
database that holds premade assets to help you get an idea on what your game should be like. Using an event system,<br>
 you can create custom Java to create unique scenarios. </p>

<p>The two main features are event and database. Database holds all the variables that make up the code of the game.<br>
 You can add characters, map packs, sprites, items etc. That are important in making your first game. <br>
You can also change the terms to give it a unique look. </p>

<p>Event system is the drag-n-drop feature for premade Java code to tell what the event to do. <br>
An example would be what will the NPC say to the player when he interacts with it, or how a specific sprite<br> 
would react when a player touches it </p>

<br>
<h4>What Important Features do you like? </h4>

<p>The features I like is the customization of the database it provides. It gives me a quick way to <br>
develop a simple game with minimal to no coding at all. It also lists the database in a user-friendly <br>
way as to invite even newcomers to try out new things.</p>

<p>One feature that stands is the plug-in system. It is a system that rewrites or adds codes to the database<br>
 that change the logic of the game. Whether adding animations to the game or changing the UI to give it a new look.</p>
