<p class="inset">My name is Ervite Juan Enrico, I am a student at APC<br>
	currently studying for Game Development.</p>
<p class="inset">I am interested in Video Games obviously, though I have<br>
	a preference in games heavy with storytelling. It could<br>
	either have a compelling campaign story or an interesting lore<br>
	I grew up reading great stories and thought on how I can <br>
	implement them in video games.<br></p>
<p class="inset">As of now, I am working on games on the RPGMAKER, which is<br>
	an game-engine which is easy to use in order for me to get<br>
	used to the development cycle. I hope to learn more from <br>
	USERDES as not only I want the player to immersed to the game,<br>
	but also to be comfortable and have fun.</p>
