           		 <p>Design Thinking Process is a suitable standard on how one should create something. 
It focuses on what the users need rather than want. It looks for the problems and the designers look for 
solutions on how to solve the problem. </p>
<br>
            		 
            		 <p>It’s difficult for even for me on how to look for the problems in people, and even 
harder on how can I fix said problem. I often end up creating complex solutions that could easily be remedied 
by other people’s methods. Though that shouldn’t stop me as it should help me look for improvements every time.
 I have a hard time empathizing with others, so I miss the mark on what they need. But if I were to become a 
Game Designer/Developer, I have to learn what people want and enjoy from the games they play. I need to have insight 
on what they need in a game, how I should design it without frustration or boredom creeping into them. </p>
<br>
<p>I do think Design Thinking Process is essential in UX design and in game development. I have difficulties
 in the first step, but I do know I have to improve upon myself in order to achieve my goals.
 I have to learn what people want, and how can I deliver it to them. <p>
