<h4>What is User Design?</h4>
<p>User Design is the process of creating a product that is easily accessed and used <br>
by the customer themselves. This involves the design intended for the user’s convenience,<br>
experience, and impression.</p> 
<h4>What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it matter? </h4>

<p>User Experience Design is the interaction and experience that user has when using a product. <br>
It's like how the designer keeps in mind how to ease the user in buying their product. <br>
The designer asks the question: Does it explain all the necessary functions it has? What it can<br> 
do for the user? How is it different from the other products and will I benefit from using this product?</p>

<p>User Interface is the visual assets found on the product. It matters as it must balance<br>
both how the user feels on using the product and how the product’s visual design. It is supposed<br> 
to be easy on the eyes with a clear layout that is comfortable to use when interacted with a user. </p>

<p>In short, User Experience Design is the intention for a user-centric design of the product. <br>
User Interface Design is the expression of the designer of how they implement the user-interface. </p>

<h4>Who are the users? Why are they important? </h4>
<p>Users are the people who use your products. They are essential in designing your User Design, as they<br> 
hold invaluable data in making your design click. Some companies have user-specialists who provide <br>
feedback in designing a prototype. They are important in the design process of a product as they are <br>
your main customers, people who will pay for your software. They should be catered first and kept in <br>
the developer’s mind on how they should solve the user’s problems. As such, user-friendly designs tend <br>
to attract future customers </p>
