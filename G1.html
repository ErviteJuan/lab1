           		<h3> What is User Design? </h3>
<br><br>
User Design is the process of creating a product that is easily accessed and used by the customer themselves. 
This involves the design intended for the user’s convenience, experience, and impression. 
<br><br>
<h3>What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it matter? </h3>
<br><br>
User Experience Design is the interaction and experience that user has when using a product. It's 
like how the designer keeps in mind how to ease the user in buying their product. The designer asks the question: 
Does it explain all the necessary functions it has? What it can do for the user? How is it different from the 
other products and will I benefit from using this product?  
<br>
User Interface is the visual assets found on the product. It matters as it must balance both how the user 
feels on using the product and how the product’s visual design. It is supposed to be easy on the eyes with 
a clear layout that is comfortable to use when interacted with a user. 
<br>
In short, User Experience Design is the intention for a user-centric design of the product. User Interface 
Design is the expression of the designer of how they implement the user-interface. 
<br><br>
<h3>Who are the users? Why are they important? </h3>
<br><br>
Users are the people who use your products. They are essential in designing your User Design, as they hold 
invaluable data in making your design click. Some companies have user-specialists who provide feedback in 
designing a prototype. They are important in the design process of a product as they are your main customers,
 people who will pay for your software. They should be catered first and kept in the developer’s mind on 
how they should solve the user’s problems. As such, user-friendly designs tend rto attract future customers
