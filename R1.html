           		 <p>Looking at what I had learned from USERDES,I learned the definition 
of UX and UI design and how these two come together, the type of clients I will encounter, 
the processes of creating a user-friendly product, and how I can integrate both to cater for 
the potential customers and clients. </p>
<br>
<p>The steps in creating an effective user interface for software hinges on the clientâ€™s needs. 
This was hammered on when researching what various people need, learning what their pain points 
are, and how it can be prevented when implementing the overall design. One way was creating 
scenarios like Personas which represent the possible types of people you encounter and give
 an idea on what the user interface should feel like. </p>
<br>
<p>One experience that could provide insight on what I should and should not do was the User 
Inyerface exercise which focused on creating an anti-user interface that was designed to 
frustrate the user. I was interested on how they manage to create the format and how they twisted
 the common UI design to fool the user. Adding steps when inputting your username, mislabeling the 
pictures, etc. It was an interesting experience and give the idea what I should not do and how 
can I prevent it when I design my own software. </p>
