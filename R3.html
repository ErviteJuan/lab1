           		 <p>Needfinding is the concept of discovering the needs of people. It is summarily 
the act of trying to find a problem that are common to everyday life. The reason why is because creating 
a product means the need of a use or purpose. You can’t create a product and not have it to solve a problem. 
I see it as a relative to the Empathic step from Design Thinking. </p>
            		
<br>
            		 <p>The concept of needfinding is new to me, and I even found its name a bit humorous, 
but I do see its application to Design Thinking as a supplement. It is an expansion of the first step Empathic. 
In which the designer looks for what the user or client want. But that was the key difference, want, the client 
wants something to solve their problem. What the designer looks for is the inherent need of the user and how it
 should be done. Most of the time, the clients say what they want, but it is usually hard or impossible to do. 
So, the designer supplements the needs to solve their problem. </p>
<br>
<p>This concept was the main problem we had in my group in what our users (personas) wanted in solving their 
problem. Our first problem was the design problem we had weren’t specific enough to create a viable product.
 If we went to our original problem, we would bend over backwards trying to please a broad audience. We ended up 
creating a narrower goal to not only have a concrete design problem, but also the ease of designing for a 
specific audience. </p>
